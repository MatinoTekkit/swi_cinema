## Non-functional requirements

### Reliability

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                                         |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR-01 | A seat must never be reserved by more than one reservation at a time, even when multiple users reserve the same seat concurrently.  |
| NFR-02 | An unpaid (`PENDING`) reservation shall hold its seats for 5 minutes. After that, the seats are released without any manual action. |

### Security

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                                               |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR-03 | The system shall identify the user through authentication, never through a value sent in the request (e.g. an email address).             |
| NFR-04 | A user shall only be able to view, pay for and cancel their own reservations.                                                             |
| NFR-05 | Admin functions shall only be accessible to users with the Admin role and shall be exposed separately from user functions (`/admin/...`). |
| NFR-06 | The system shall not process or store payment card data. Payments are handled by an external payment gateway.                             |

### Usability

| ID     | Requirement                                                                               |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR-07 | For a `PENDING` reservation, the UI shall show the time at which the reservation expires. |
| NFR-08 | The seat selection shall visually distinguish available, selected and occupied seats.     |

### Constraints

| ID     | Requirement                                                                                                  |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR-09 | The system shall use a client–server architecture: a client communicates with the server through a REST API. |
| NFR-10 | The server shall be implemented in Java with Spring Boot and shall use an SQLite database.                   |
| NFR-11 | All prices shall be in CZK.                                                                                  |
